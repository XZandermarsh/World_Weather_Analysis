# World_Weather_Analysis
## Purpose
### This is a set of tools used to visualize weather, plan a vacation, and create a directions map for a trip around the country of Australia, as an example

### The Weather_Database folder contains the raw weather data for over 600 cities and the .ipynb file used to create the data file via openweather API. 

### The Vacation_Search folder contains an .ipynb file that allows the user to specify a temperature range for a trip, and the program creates a list of filtered cities with suggested hotels based on proximity to the cities using google's places API.

### The Vacation_Itinerary folder contains an .ipynb file that creates a directional map around Australia using only city names as inputs, and this could be modified for any trip. This uses Google's Directions API.
